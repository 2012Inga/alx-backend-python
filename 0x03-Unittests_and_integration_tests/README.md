## Introduction

The goal of this project is to learn and practice writing unit tests and integration tests for Python code. You will explore concepts such as parameterization, mocking, and fixtures to create comprehensive and reliable test suites. This project will enhance your ability to write robust Python applications that can be confidently deployed and maintained.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Understand the difference between unit and integration tests.
- Apply common testing patterns such as mocking, parameterization, and fixtures.
- Write clear and effective test cases using Python's `unittest` framework.
- Utilize `parameterized` to expand test coverage with multiple test cases.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7
- Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
- `pycodestyle` version 2.5 for code style checks
- `parameterized` library for parameterized testing

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/alx-backend-python.git
   cd alx-backend-python/0x03-Unittests_and_integration_tests

2. Create a virtual environment:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

3. Install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Install pycodestyle and parameterized:

pip install pycodestyle==2.5 parameterized


USAGE:-

This project includes several Python modules and test files. Here’s a brief overview of the key components:

utils.py: Contains utility functions to be tested.
client.py: Client-side code interacting with external services.
fixtures.py: Includes sample data and setup for testing.

Running Tests
To run the tests for this project, use the unittest framework. Execute the following command from the project directory:

python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p "*.py"

This command will discover and run all test files in the tests directory.


Running Specific Test Files
To run a specific test file, use the following command:

python3 test_utils.py

Running Tests with parameterized
The parameterized library is used to expand tests with multiple parameters. Make sure you have it installed, as shown in the installation section.

Code Style
Ensure your code adheres to the pycodestyle guidelines:

pycodestyle your_python_file.py
